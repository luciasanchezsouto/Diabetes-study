# Importance of studying diabetes and purpose
Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy.
To study this problem, we used a dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System of 2015). The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes: 0 is for no diabetes or only during pregnancy (<100 mg/dL), 1 is for prediabetes (100-125 mg/dL), and 2 is for diabetes (>125 mg/dL). 

This dataset has 21 feature variables that can help us see which one have a bigger relation with this health condition and see if they can be used to predict that a person is at high risk of suffering this disease.
